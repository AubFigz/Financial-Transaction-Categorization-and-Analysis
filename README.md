## Overview
The Financial Confidence Platform AI/ML Stack Solutions program is designed to develop advanced machine learning solutions for transaction categorization within the financial confidence platform company. This program incorporates various AI/ML techniques, including feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model selection, and model persistence, to build and evaluate a machine learning model for accurately categorizing user transactions.

## Key Features
1. **Database Connectivity:** Connects to a SQLite database containing transaction data to retrieve and preprocess the data for machine learning.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocesses transaction data by converting descriptions to lowercase and removing punctuation to prepare it for feature extraction.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Utilizes the `TfidfVectorizer` to transform transaction descriptions into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) representation.

4. **Model Training:** Implements a machine learning pipeline using a random forest classifier for training the model on the preprocessed transaction data.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Conducts hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` to optimize the random forest classifier's performance by searching over a predefined hyperparameter grid.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the trained model's performance on a separate testing dataset using accuracy score and classification report metrics to assess its categorization accuracy and effectiveness.

7. **Model Persistence:** Saves the trained model to a file using `joblib` for future use, deployment, and integration into the financial confidence platform's backend infrastructure.

## Class Structure
The program consists of the following class:

### `FinancialConfidenceML`
- **Attributes:**
  - `db_file`: Path to the SQLite database file.
  - `conn`: SQLite database connection object.

- **Methods:**
  - `__init__(self, db_file)`: Initializes the object with the database file path.
  - `connect_to_database(self)`: Connects to the SQLite database.
  - `disconnect_from_database(self)`: Disconnects from the SQLite database.
  - `get_transaction_data(self)`: Retrieves transaction data from the database.
  - `preprocess_data(self, df)`: Preprocesses transaction data for machine learning.
  - `train_model(self, X_train, y_train)`: Trains a random forest classifier model with hyperparameter tuning.
  - `evaluate_model(self, clf, X_test, y_test)`: Evaluates the trained model's performance.
  - `save_model(self, clf, model_file)`: Saves the trained model to a file.

## Usage
1. **Initialization:** Create a `FinancialConfidenceML` object by providing the path to the SQLite database file.
2. **Connect to Database:** Call the `connect_to_database()` method to establish a connection to the database.
3. **Retrieve Transaction Data:** Retrieve transaction data using the `get_transaction_data()` method.
4. **Preprocess Data:** Preprocess the transaction data for machine learning using the `preprocess_data()` method.
5. **Train Model:** Train the machine learning model using the `train_model()` method, which includes hyperparameter tuning.
6. **Evaluate Model:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using the `evaluate_model()` method.
7. **Save Model:** Save the trained model to a file using the `save_model()` method for future use and deployment.
